# Student Java Project

This project defines a simple `Student` class in Java, which allows for the creation and management of student information. The `Student` class includes properties for the student's name and roll number, along with methods to set and display these details.

## Files

- **Student.java**: Contains the definition of the `Student` class with methods to set and display student details.
- **Main.java**: Contains the `main` method to execute the program and demonstrate the functionality of the `Student` class.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Compile the Java files using the following command:
   ```
   javac src/main/java/*.java
   ```
4. Run the `Main` class using the following command:
   ```
   java src/main/java/Main
   ```

This will create an instance of the `Student` class, set the details, and display them in the console.
